# atproto Clojure SDK

Work very much in progress

Multi-platform codebase designed to work in Clojure, ClojureScript and ClojureDart.

## Usage

### ATProto Client

The workflow for utilizing the client is to:

1. Obtain a session by specifying the ATProto endpoint and (optionally) authentication credentials.
2. Use the session to make query or procedure calls to ATProto or Bluesky endpoints.

The SDK supports three types of session:
1. Unauthenticated sessions to make API calls to public atproto application endpoints like [Bluesky](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference).
2. Credentials sessions to use with your own username/password for CLI tools.
3. OAuth sessions to connect to your users' Personal Data Servers and make API calls on their behalf.

`query` and `procedure` calls use the "NSID" of the query or procedure, and a Clojure map of parameters.

All calls (including the call to `create`) are asynchronous, and return immediately. The return value depends on platform:

- Clojure: a Clojure promise.
- ClojureScript: a core.async channel.
- ClojureDart: a Dart Watchable.

You can also provide a `:channel`, `:callback` or `:promise` keyword option to recieve the return value. Not all options are supported on all platforms.

```clojure
(require '[atproto.client :as client])

;; Unauthenticated client to public endpoint
(def client @(client/create {:service "https://public.api.bsky.app"}))

;; Bluesky endpoints and their query params can be found here:
;; https://docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference

;; Credentials-based authenticated client
(def client @(client/create {:credentials {:identifier "<me.bsky.social>"
                                           :password "SECRET"}}))

;; Issue a query with the client
@(client/query client {:op :app.bsky.actor.getProfile
                   :params {:actor "<me.bsky.social>"}})

;; => {:handle "<me.bsky.social>" ... }

;; Using core.async
(def result (async/chan))
(at/query client
          {:op :app.bsky.actor.getProfile
           :params {:actor "<me.bsky.social>"}}
          :channel result)
(async/<!! result)
```

### Jetstream

Connect to Bluesky's [Jetstream service](https://docs.bsky.app/blog/jetstream) to get real-time updates of public network data. Jetstream provides a JSON-based alternative to the binary CBOR firehose, making it easier to work with post streams, likes, follows, and other events.

The Jetstream implementation is currently only supported for JVM Clojure.

```clojure
(require '[atproto.jetstream :as jet])
(require '[clojure.core.async :as a]))

;; Define a channel to recieve events
(def events-ch (a/chan))

;; Subscribe to the jetstream
(def control-ch (jet/consume events-ch :wanted-collections ["app.bsky.feed.post"]))

;; Consume events
(a/go-loop [count 0]
  (if-let [event (a/<! events-ch)]
    (do
      (when (zero? (rem count 100)) (println (format "Got %s posts" count)))
      (recur (inc count)))
    (println "event channel closed")))

;; Stop processing
(a/close! control-ch)
```
